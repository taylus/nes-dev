An NES ROM which displays a sprite on the screen which the player can move with the controller.

Adapted from [Nerdy Nights week 5](http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=7974) and building upon [my previous sprites demo](../05-sprites/)

Includes a Lua script for displaying key memory addresses.
