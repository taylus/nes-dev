An NES ROM which displays a background + a sprite on the screen the player can move.

Graphics ripped from SMB1, background built in [NES Screen Tool](https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml) by Shiru.

Adapted from [Nerdy Nights week 6](http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=8172) and building upon [my previous demo](../07-controller-input/).
